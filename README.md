1) Exposes numeric settings for all feats. You can now change things like percent calorie need reduction for Efficient Machine, or the number of kilometers travelled required to unlock Snow Walker.
2) Unlocks legacy feat, "Master Hunter". If it ever disappears from the game entirely, **I'll add it back in!**
3) (WIP) Provides simple mod-side framwork for compiling new feat mods. A lot of work is needed to get the game to treat them as feats, but the game also does a lot of work itself for feats - which should be usable to extend the system similar to other mods of mine. Stay tuned!
